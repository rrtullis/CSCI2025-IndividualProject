Explanation of files:
db.py - the file that was used to create the SQLite database. 
mastodon_posts.db - a database where fetched posts' relevant information is stored. Will likely be reset several times before the project is complete.
fetch_posts.py - Contains functions to fetch, clean, and (eventually) rate the sentiment of posts. WIP.

Note on environment management: I am in the process of setting up Conda. I will push when setup is complete.
